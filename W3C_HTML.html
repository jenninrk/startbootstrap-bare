                <p>W3C stands for the World Wide Web Consortium, and is the governing standards body for the Internet. </p>

                <p>The ongoing development and management of the Internet, which was founded by Tim Berens-Lee in 1989 – who incidentally filed for no patents nor sought any royalties for this development,  - is directed by this body, which, under the leadership of Tim Berens-Lee and the W3C CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, has as it’s primary mission to lead the Web to achieve its fullest potential.</p>

                <p>The Vision of the W3C is broadly defined as the participation in the sharing of knowledge and the building of trust, on a global scale, across the Internet. </p>

                <p>W3C’s principles are five fold, as follows:  one, open standards for all users.  Two, Design principles that encourage ubiquitous broad use and transparency, such as web for all, and web on everything. Three, web for rich interaction, and four, web of data and services, examples of which include essential XML, semantic web, web services, such as linked data and exchange message services.  Finally, the fifth principle is web of trust, which ensures that data exchanges of a sensitivie and/or proprietary nature can be conducted with confidence. 	</p>

                <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the language for documents intended to be displayed in a web browser, or on ta website on the internet. CSS or Cascading style sheets, enhances HTML by giving descriptive look and feel to text as it is presented on the World Wide Web.  Bold, Italics, underlining, fonts and color, are all effects achieved through the CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, inside the HTML language</p>
